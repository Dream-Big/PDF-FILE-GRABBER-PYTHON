# PDF-FILE-GRABBER-PYTHON
This project aims to create software that searches for and retrieves relevant PDF files from the web.
---------------------------
The idea is to use multiple search engines and extract as much relevant pdf files as possible.
---------------------------
V-0.0.1.x are iterations that work with www.duckduckgo.com/html
---------------------------
v-0.0.2.x are iterations that work with www.bing.com
---------------------------
I would like to extend the functionality to multiple search engines.
As well as content filtering for more relevant results.

Thank you.
