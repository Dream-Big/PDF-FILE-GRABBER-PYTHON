# PDF-FILE-GRABBER-PYTHON
This project aims to create software that searches for and retrieves relevant PDF files from the web.
---------------------------
The idea is to use multiple search engines and extract as much relavent pdf files as possible.
---------------------------
As of writing this, The search engine used is only www.duckduckgo.com/html 
---------------------------
I would like to extend the functionality to multiple search engines.
